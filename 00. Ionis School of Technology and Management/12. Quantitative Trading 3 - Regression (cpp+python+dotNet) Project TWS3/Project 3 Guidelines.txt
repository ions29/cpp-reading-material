The students will be further developing and collaborating their findings from the prior Project to establish 
conditional rules that trigger real-time market order on the basis of buying pressure, volume, selling 
pressure, lack of volume, in addition to other determinants discussed in class. Students will receive an 
individual grade as well as a group grade which combines for 500 points. 

At this junction, the students 
are primarily responsible for producing outputs with their indicators without any market orders attached 
to the information. In the week which ensues we will be working to target various order on both the 
underlying securities as well as their derivative contracts. The premise of this exercise is to evaluate a 
larger market (WTI, or BTHâ€¦ for example) and to determine what happens to their respective ETF tickers, 
or relative markets which are cased in iBoxx Market derivatives (as an example) which we will be 
evaluating in the following week.
