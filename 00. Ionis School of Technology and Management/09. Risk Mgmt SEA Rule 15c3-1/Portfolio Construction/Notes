[ticker]: :[GICS] > [HISTORICAL VOLUME] > [BETA] > [CAPITAL REQUIREMENT] > [BID-ASK SPREAD] > [COND n]

REMINDER:   The Ticker score is the total sum of all delimiters you are qualifying.

          USING THE [ +1 / -1 ] METHODOLOGY,
         
            EX: Using GICS Sector for Financials/Banks = -500
              > would make it impossible for your system to qualify the sector for investment (Blacklist)
            
            EX: Ticker score = -500
              > would make it impossible for your system to qualify the ticker for investment (Blacklist)
