We are looking to qualify and case the following information to determine the minimum capital requirements for the following instruments.   
Asset Type (Govt, Corp, Muni, etc...) 

  Corporate Name/ Identifier (US Treasury, AAPL Corp, New York State, etc...)

  Coupon (Don't forget to check for zero coupon bonds)
  
  Maturity (You can obtain this by parsing the string in the contract details)

  Rating  (You can obtain this by parsing the string in the contract details)

Here are some resources help you better qualify investment/junk grade bonds when you are running them through your algos..

Credit Ratings should be qualified using a combined methodology as all instruments are not necessarily rated by all three major credit ratings agencies 
  (S&P, Moody's, Fitch)

# Moody's
- https://ratings.moodys.io/ratings

# S&P Capital IQ
- https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/

# Fitch
- https://www.fitchratings.com/

Here are some additional resources which you can refer to to help you qualify the assets that you are running through your algorithms.
