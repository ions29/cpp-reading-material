TWS, Exercise 4                                   IF YOU CAN HAVE THIS COMPLETED BY MONDAY THAT WOULD BE FINE.

#     TWS4:    Derivative Contract Execution

              # The point of this exercise is to further on TWS3.
              # Your program has identified value and needs to execute more complex order types.



 PART I.

      CONDITIONS [ +1 ] [ -1]
      *** I would like to see 3 (at least)
      
 [+1] || [-1]
              A.  CONDITION OF A RATE IN CHANGE INCREASE/DECREASE IN VOLUME
 
 [+1] || [-1]
              B.  CONDITION THE DIFFERENCE IN THE BID AND ASK PRICE (THE BID ASK SPREAD)
                *** WIDER MEANS THE DIFFERENCE IS GREATER AND THE PRICE SHOULD GO LOWER
                *** TIGHER MEANS THE DIFFERENCE IS SMALLER AND THE PRICE SHOULD GO HIGHER
 
 [+1] || [-1]
              C.  CONDITION BOTH THE BID AND ASK PRICE, RELATIVE TO THE CURRENT (LAST TRADED PRICE)
      
              ***** YOU'RE GOING TO NEED THE ABSOLUTE VALUE TO ASSESS THE DIFFERENCE AS WELL...
              
              ***** LAST_TRADE - BID_PRICE   = WHAT IS THE SPREAD BETWEEN THE BID_PRICE AND THE LAST_TRADE
                                        ***** IS THE BIAS TOWARDS A STRONGER BID OR A STRONGER ASK PRICE.
              ***** LAST_TRADE - ASK_PRICE

          NOTE:   IF THE LAST_TRADE - ASK_PRICE IS MOVING HIGHER, FOR EXAMPLE THE BIAS IS "BULLISH" IF THE BID_PRICE IS MOVING IN TANDEM.

          NOTE:   AS FOR THE LAST_TRADE, YOU CAN ALSO CHECK TO SEE THE QUANTITY THAT WAS TRADED TO AVOID A SMALL TRADE.
                EFFECTIVELY, IF YOU SEE A LARGER NUMBER OF SHARES TRADED, YOU CAN USE THAT AS A CONFIDENCE LEVEL IN THE DATA.
                
                THE LARGER THE TRADE, THE MORE "VALUABLE" THE INFORMATION IS, AND IF YOU SEE A "LARGE" NUMBER OF SHARES TRADE 
                RELATIVE TO ORDINARY VOLUME, IT IS AN ADDITIONAL INDICATOR OF VALUE 

IF YOU ARE FEELING AMBITIOUS, TRY TO CASE TWO ADDITIONAL

PART 2.   TRIGGER THE ORDERS AUTOMATICALLY DURING MARKET HOURS.

      Upon arrival of an instance where there is a high probability of a change in price (for better or for worse)

        A.  Your program must request all available derivative contracts (options) for the underlying security.
  
        B.  Determine which of those contracts make the most sense to purchase.
    
          e.g.:   Do not buy the option contracts that are $50 out of the money for a $60 stock.
   
        C.  We are going to work these with Limit orders later...
          
            **** For the purpose of this exercise you place a MARKET ORDER for all relevant contracts.
  
        D.  You will also be purchasing the natural underlying security, in addition to N-number of option contracts.
    
    *****   I will be reviewing your work on Tuesday, the 17th of January so if you run into any speed bumps... 
        ... don't worry about it as the 17th is a soft deadline, I'll give you all a few extra days depending on where you all are at.
