  MEMORY
    ● Memory is a byte array.
    ● Complex types (anything > 32 bytes such as structs, arrays, and strings) must be stored in memory or in storage.
        ○ string memory name = “STORAGE”;
    ● Arguments must be copied to memory before calling an `internal` function or when a contract makes an external call (AKA calling a function on another contract).
    ● Memory is cheap, but the cost of memory grows quadratically.

  STORAGE
    ● Using storage is very expensive and should be used sparingly.
    ● Writing to storage is most expensive.
    ● Reading from storage is cheaper, but still relatively expensive.
    ● mappings and state variables are always in storage.
    ● Some gas is refunded when storage is deleted or set to 0 (checkout
          https://gastoken.io/ for an interesting use of this).

    ●●● Variables < 32 bytes can be packed into 32 byte slots.
    
      Event logs
      ● Event logs are a cheap way of storing data that does not need to be accessed by any contracts.
      ● Events are stored in transaction receipts, rather than in storage.
