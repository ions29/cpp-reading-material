# VALUE TYPES
  ● uint256
  ● address (bytes20)
    ○ balance, transfer, call, delegatecall
  ● bytes32
  ● bool

        STACK VARIABLES
            ● Stack variables are generally the cheapest to use and can be used for any simple types (anything that is <= 32 bytes).
              ○ uint256 a = 123;
            ● All simple types are represented as bytes32 at the EVM level.
            ● Only 16 stack variables can exist within a single scope.

        CALLDATA
            ● Calldata is a read-only byte array.
            ● Every byte of a transaction’s calldata costs gas (68 gas per non-zero byte, 4 gas per zero byte).
                ○○○   A function with more arguments (and larger calldata) will always cost more gas.
            ● It is cheaper to load variables directly from calldata, rather than copying them to memory.
                ○○○   This can be accomplished by marking a function as `external`.
