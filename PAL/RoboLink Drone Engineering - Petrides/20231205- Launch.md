## Before We Launch

# Orientation

**Correct Orientation** <br>
Always place your drone on the helipad facing away from you before take-off. Pointing the camera away from you is a good idea because when you PITCH Forward, the drone will fly in the direction the camera is facing, or away from you. From this orientation, when you ROLL Left, the drone will fly to your left, and when you ROLL Right, the drone will fly to your right.
<br>
Crashes commonly occur when the pilot loses track of the orientation of his or her drone. If the done is facing towards you, for example, left is right and right is left. With practice, you will get used to this, but it takes some time. It’s easy to make a mistake, especially when you find yourself in a tight spot, and your reflexes take over. Take your time and try to remain calm.

**Stand Far Away** <br>

It’s important that everyone on your team stands at a safe distance behind your drone. If you can reach down and touch the drone; you’re too close. Allow more room than you think. The bigger the drone; the farther back you should stand. No one should be between the PIC and the drone, for visibility and safety.

**Use a Helipad** <br>

We recommend using a HELIPAD because it is safer, and to help keep your drone from getting damaged. The propellers create wind that can hurl dirt, dust, rocks and debris in all directions. This same dirt and debris can damage drone motors and propellers. A helipad can also help prevent tall grass and weeds from getting wrapped around the rotors causing damage. You can purchase a foldable cloth helipad from many sources. Most come with stakes to hold it place, so it’s also a good idea to add a mallet to your drone bag. Helipads usually have a different color on each side, allowing you to choose the one that provides the greatest visibility.

**Alert Your Surroundings** <br>

Before we launch, we always yell three times loudly; “Drone Going Up, Drone Going Up, Drone Going Up!” This is about safety. Yell loudly, so everyone can hear you!
<br>
Before we land, we always yell; “Drone Landing! Drone Landing, Drone Landing!”
<br>
**“Why?”**
<br>
What if you’re flying in a park, and someone’s out walking his or her dog? Do you think they’re paying attention to what’s happening in the sky high above them? Maybe, but maybe not. Calling out “Drone Landing” three times alerts any passersby of a potential threat.
