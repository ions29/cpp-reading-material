# NAVIGATION

A picture, drawing, tablet or even a TV screen has two dimensions. If we plotted these two dimensions on a graph, or chart we’d call them the X-Axis and the Y-Axis. <br>
The X and Y axis describes a flat world. On TV or in a movie, everything is represented to us in a flat picture.  <br>
We call the two dimensions width and height. <br>

Hold your fingers as shown in the diagram. Your pointer finger is X, your middle finger is Y and your thumb is Z. Z is the third dimension; up and down. When we fly, we can go forward and back. That’s X. We can go side-to-side. That’s Y. AND we can go up and down. That’s Z!

We’re learning to think in 3D!<br>

(1) & (2)	Forward and Back	X Axis<br>
(3) & (4)	Side-to-Side	Y Axis<br>
(5) & (6)	Up and Down	Z Axis<br>
 
 
In AVIATION we have a special language to describe these directions, which we’ll get to next, but first we have to define a new vocabulary word.<br>

AVIATION: Refers to flying, using a mechanical aircraft like an airplane. <br>
It also includes the activities and industries related to flight, such as airlines, air traffic control and airplane manufacturers.<br><br>
Another name for a PILOT is an AVIATOR, which is a person who operates an aircraft. <br>
<br>**That means that everyone who flies a drone is an Aviator too!**

THROTTLE, YAW, PITCH, ROLL!<br>
<br>
Flying Forward and Backward is called **PITCH**.
<br>
Flying side-to-side is called **ROLL**. It’s called this because an airplane, like a fighter jet, actually rolls…. 
<br>
A quadcopter just dips a little to fly in a sideways direction. 
<br>
And a drone flying up and down is called **THROTTLE**.

A drone turning Left or turning Right is called **YAW**. 
<br>Imagine your drone was hanging from a string connected to the center of your drone. <br>
If your drone turns around without swinging the string, that’s called “Rotating on a Fixed-Vertical Axis”<br>

That’s a fancy way of saying YAW.

When you speak to fellow students or pilots, or when you give your partner directions, you should begin using these terms
