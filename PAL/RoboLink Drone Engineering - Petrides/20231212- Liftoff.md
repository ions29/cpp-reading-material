1. A Drone with 4-propellers is a Quadcopter.
2. A Drone with 6-propellers is a Hexcopter.
3. A drone with 8-proppelers is an OctoCopter.
- an OctoCopter can lose two motors and still fly safely.
- In this class we will be using Quadcopters.


Here is a diagram of the motors, which are labeled in a clockwise direction <br>
