1. Put on your safety goggles.
2. Check the battery.
3. Check for broken parts.
4. Check the motors.
5. Check the propellers.

**Think of holding a balloon under water, what happens when you let go?**

<br>

1. A Drone with 4-propellers is a Quadcopter.
2. A Drone with 6-propellers is a Hexcopter.
3. A drone with 8-proppelers is an OctoCopter.
- an OctoCopter can lose two motors and still fly safely.
- In this class we will be using Quadcopters.


Here is a diagram of the motors, which are labeled in a clockwise direction <br>

# X-PATTERN

**Propellers 1 & 3 turn clockwise.** <br>
**Propellers 2 & 4 turn counterclockwise.** <br>

# CREATING THRUST

The opposite force of air by the propellers create the upward thrust.<br>
There is a small ridge on the propellers that tells you which motors are rotating in a clockwise direction.<br>

### THIS CAUSES THE COPTER TO TAKE OFF.

## LEADING EDGE

The side of the blade that is not touching the table.<br>
The propeller always turns in the direction of the leading edge.<br>

# Achieving Lift-Off

Before we begin, let’s review the steps to launch:<br>

Always remember to put your safety glasses on, because we always wear safety glasses whenever we fly drones.<br>

Conduct a thorough Pre-Flight Checklist; review Unit 4 –  Prepare to Launch.<br>

Place your drone in front of you with the camera facing away from you and the battery facing towards you.<br>

Yell, “Drone going up, drone going up, drone going up!”<br>

Now if all goes as it should, you are happily flying your drone. But if not…this lesson is for you.<br>

Have you ever had the unfortunate experience of trying to launch your drone, and one side tilts up an inch or two, and then immediately falls back down? This is usually accompanied by a very unsatisfying sound, like a zipper being pulled quickly.<br>

# FAILURE TO LAUNCH

Here’s the basic principle: To achieve AERODYNAMIC BUOYANCY (which is a fancy way of saying, it floats on air) each propeller on a QUADCOPTER must match its partner on the opposite arm, in an “X“ Pattern.”<br><br>


In this article we’re going to show you how to prevent one of the most common problems that can cause a “Failure to Launch.” Understanding some basic principles will help you avoid future frustration.
<br>
In order to determine exactly what caused a “Failure to Launch” you may have to use testing, observation, troubleshooting, critical thinking, order of operations and other observational skills to complete your drone missions.
<br>
You should first check the following:

<br>Do you have a full battery?
<br>Are all the motors turning properly?
<br>Finally, check the propellers and the propeller guards, if your drone has them. Make sure they are firmly attached and seated correctly. Check for any cracks, chips or bends. Flick each propeller with your finger and make sure it is not hitting a propeller guard. Replace a propeller or guard that has any of these issues.
Check that all the motors are turning freely. A motor that is stiff, or the propeller doesn’t keep spinning when flicked, may indicate that it is close to the end of its life, or burned out. Motors need to be replaced periodically as part of general maintenance, and it’s a good idea to replace them before they fail.
<br><br>If all those things are good; it may be a different problem with the propellers…


**AERODYNAMICS** is the study of how objects move through air. The wing of a plane, for example, is designed to slip through the air smoothly, without much drag.<br>

We discussed an aerodynamic shape called an Airfoil, which can be found in the wing of a bird, or the fin of a fish, dolphin or shark. This shape allows the animal to move more efficiently, and with less effort.<br>


**BUOYANCY** is the upward force that pushes up against the weight of an object suspended in a liquid, like water; or a gas, like air.  This force causes the object to rise up, or float.<br>

## Quadcopter
- A Quadcopter needs all 4 rotors to fly.

## Hexacopter
- A Hexacopter can lose 1 rotor and still land safely.

## Octocopter
- An Octocopter can lose 2 rotors and still fly AND land safely!
