1. Put on your safety goggles.
2. Check the battery.
3. Check for broken parts.
4. Check the motors.
5. Check the propellers.

**Think of holding a balloon under water, what happens when you let go?**

<br>

1. A Drone with 4-propellers is a Quadcopter.
2. A Drone with 6-propellers is a Hexcopter.
3. A drone with 8-proppelers is an OctoCopter.
- an OctoCopter can lose two motors and still fly safely.
- In this class we will be using Quadcopters.


Here is a diagram of the motors, which are labeled in a clockwise direction <br>

# X-PATTERN

### Propellers 1 & 3 turn clockwise
### Propellers 2 & 4 turn counterclockwise.


# CREATING THRUST

The opposite force of air by the propellers create the upward thrust.<br>
There is a small ridge on the propellers that tells you which motors are rotating in a clockwise direction.<br>

### THIS CAUSES THE COPTER TO TAKE OFF.

# LEADING EDGE

The side of the blade that is not touching the table.<br>
The propeller always turns in the direction of the leading edge.<br>
