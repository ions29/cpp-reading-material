# Introduction to Drone Use

Future Trends
Drones are an emerging technology that has grown dramatically in the past few years, and will continue to evolve at an astounding speed. Consider that the FAA offered the first Unmanned Remote Pilot Certification in August of 2016. Since then, consumer drones have become more and more sophisticated. First only used for photography, drones have become more robust and their uses have become more innovative than many realize. Already they are used for a wide variety of things that weren’t even thought of five or ten years ago. 
Right now, drones are doing things that weren’t possible 3 years ago.
We’ll talk more about the uses of drones and add more field videos as the months go by, so keep logging in to see what’s new.

PHOTOGRAPHY
Because a drone has a camera, its first and most obvious use is for taking pictures, or photography. Drones have transformed real estate marketing by providing beautiful aerial shots, panoramas and video used to showcase land, homes, buildings and their surroundings from a bird’s eye view. This is just the beginning. Cinematography, or movie-making, has been transformed so much by drones that you can hardly watch a movie or turn on the TV anymore without seeing some fabulous drone footage. It’s so ubiquitous, or common-place, that we’ve come to expect to see aerial views in nature programs, travel scenes, dramatic chase scenes and action adventures. 
 
Offshore Wind
Offshore wind farms are currently located in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Germany, and China. New projects are underway in Taiwan and the US in New York and Massachusetts. More than 10,000 jobs will be supported in the US alone. Drones are routinely used to inspect these mammoth structures. The New York project is projected to produce 9,000 MegaWatts of power by 2035, almost twice the amount generated by Niagara Falls power plants in the US and Canada combined. It’s safe to say that Drone pilots with the specialized training and certifications required to conduct wind turbine inspections will be in high demand.

Drone Delivery & Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS)
As the FAA creates new rules to make our skies safer, drones will soon be permitted to fly Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) thus opening the door for drone deliveries. For Years several major companies including Zipline, DHL, UPS, Amazon and Wing have been testing their drone delivery systems, mostly in countries that allow drone flight beyond LOS. This has helped prepare them as the FAA has begun to create new rules, allowing drones to fly beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS). Tests are now underway in the US, and we predict that routine drone deliveries will be “a thing” in the next couple of years.

The FAA has been granting BVLOS drone waivers to operate autonomously in certain cases and in specific areas, with North Carolina becoming the first state in the US to be granted routine flights BVLOS in 2019 to deliver tissue samples and medical supplies at WakeMed center.
The race is on for retailers to begin deliveries to consumers.
o	December 2013 the first DHL Parcelcopter made its maiden voyage delivering medical supplies via drones in Germany.
o	Fall 2016 Wing, a division of Alphabet, started by Google X, delivered more than a thousand meals to Virginia Tech students and employees as part of a test. 
o	December 7, 2016 Amazon Prime Air delivered its first package by fully autonomous drone in Cambridge, England.
o	2016 Zipline became the first sustained medical supply drone delivery system, delivering blood and life-saving medications in hard-to-reach areas of Rwanda, Africa.
o	2019 UPS and Matternet teamed up to create the first FAA approved Drone Airline in the US, delivering medical supplies autonomously to WakeMed Hospital near Raleigh, NC.
o	2019 UPS and CVS received a waiver to test its medical delivery program in North Carolina.
o	August 2020 Amazon received approval from the FAA to operate its drone delivery service to customers “safely and efficiently.”
o	September 2020 Walmart partners with Zipline to conduct on-demand consumer drone deliveries as part of a pilot program within a 50-mile radius near Fayetteville, NC.
o	October 2020 North Carolina Department of Transportation was Awarded First-Ever Waiver for Drone Bridge Inspections for American Robotics to operate its Scout Drone autonomously BVLOS.
o	2021 Zipline has now completed almost 100,000 drone deliveries.
At Drone Cadets we like to make learning fun for our students, by conducting our own drone deliveries . Here a drone delivers a drone to a new drone cadet.
