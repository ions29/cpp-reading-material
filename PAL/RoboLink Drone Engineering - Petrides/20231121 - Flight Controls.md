### Flight Dimensions
we call these names navigational direction terminology to help us understand
what we are describing let's first talk about the dimensions of the world in which we live a picture

drawing tablet or even a tv screen has two dimensions<br><br>

if we plotted these two dimensions on a graph or a chart we'd call them the x-axis and the y-axis the x and y axis describes a flat world<br>

on tv or in a movie everything is represented to us on a flat screen <br>

we call the two dimensions width and height<br><br>

It's the difference between a square and a cube a square has two dimensions width and height

a cube has three dimensions width height and depth

## Drone Flight dimensions

we have to think of it in three dimensions or as we say 3d<br>

your pointer finger is x<br>
- forward and back<br>

your middle finger is y<br>
- side to side<br>

your thumb is z <br>
- up and down<br>

z is the third dimension<br>


### PITCH

**Flying forward and backward.**

### ROLL

**Flying side to side.**

## THROTTLE

**Up and down.**

## YAW

**Turning Left or Turning Right**

For drones, this means you are on a fixed axis "like a yoyo hanging on a string" and you change your direction that way.





In aviation we have a special language to describe these directions<br>

aviation refers to flying using aircraft like an airplane it also includes the activities in industries related to flight such as air traffic control a pilot is also called an aviator so 

### Everyone who takes this course is an aviator

the first african-american male or female to ever get an international pilot's license
she's a pioneer aviator who lived from 1892 to 1926.

Bessie Coleman was an early American civil aviator. She was the first African-American woman and first Native American to hold a pilot license. <br>
She earned her license from the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale on June 15, 1921, and was the first African-American to earn an international pilot's license. 




### You've never lived till you've flown

<br>
- Born in Texas almost 12 years before the first airplane ever took off.<br>
- Women were flying France at that time, and she started applying to schools.<br>
- There was not one signle pilot school for women at that time.<br>
- Was accepted later to the best school in France, and had to learn French.<br>
- Became a barn burner which is an aerial acrobat that flew flips, figure eights and loop di loops.<br>
- Did some parachute jumping as well.<br><br>

## Drone Pilots: Oath to Flying Safely.

I will always complete my pre-flight checklist.<br>
I will never fly my drone over people tha are not on my team.<br>
I will never fly over moving vehicles.<br>
I will never fly above 400 feet.<br>
I will never fly near an airport.<br>
I will always be aware of my weather and surroundings.<br>
I will never fly at night.<br>
I will always keep my drone in sight.<br>
I will always call out loudly before takeoff and landing.<br>
I will always keep safety first.<br>

## SAFEETY PRINCIPLES
Drones can be dangerous.  They have extremely fast-moving propellers that can hurt you, or someone else. Animals and other living things can be hurt by drones too. A drone crash can cause damage, not only to people and animals, but to property, creating unsafe situations or conditions. Let’s face it. Flying drones is a BIG responsibility. In fact, it may be the biggest responsibility you’ve ever had in your entire life. We congratulate you for taking your role as a drone pilot seriously, by taking the first step towards educating yourself. <br>

Even when you follow generally accepted safety principles—crashes are inevitable. It’s not a matter of if, but when. Every pilot crashes. That’s why we recommend learning to fly with a smaller drone, like a DJI Tello, before moving up to a bigger drone. In addition, we require all students (of any age) to wear protective eye gear or safety glasses. Never fly indoors without propeller guards. Even better, it’s a good idea to purchase an additional safety cage, if it is available for your drone. Additionally, we recommend that children, under the age of 18 should only fly with adult supervision. <br>

More and more, it seems, you can find stories about drones being flown in ways that show complete ignorance, or disregard for the FAA Rules. All drone pilots in the US, even hobbyists, have a responsibility to follow these rules. Flying drones is a privilege and if we don’t follow the rules, that privilege will be taken away from us. Safety is a choice. We encourage you to Always Keep Safety First. <br>
