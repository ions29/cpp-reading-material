### Flight Dimensions
we call these names navigational direction terminology to help us understand
what we are describing let's first talk about the dimensions of the world in which we live a picture

drawing tablet or even a tv screen has two dimensions<br><br>

if we plotted these two dimensions on a graph or a chart we'd call them the x-axis and the y-axis the x and y axis describes a flat world<br>

on tv or in a movie everything is represented to us on a flat screen <br>

we call the two dimensions width and height<br><br>

It's the difference between a square and a cube a square has two dimensions width and height

a cube has three dimensions width height and depth

## Drone Flight dimensions

we have to think of it in three dimensions or as we say 3d<br>

your pointer finger is x<br>
- forward and back<br>

your middle finger is y<br>
- side to side<br>

your thumb is z <br>
- up and down<br>

z is the third dimension<br>


### PITCH

**Flying forward and backward.**

### ROLL

**Flying side to side.**

## THROTTLE

**Up and down.**

## YAW

**Turning Left or Turning Right**

For drones, this means you are on a fixed axis "like a yoyo hanging on a string" and you change your direction that way.





In aviation we have a special language to describe these directions<br>

aviation refers to flying using aircraft like an airplane it also includes the activities in industries related to flight such as air traffic control a pilot is also called an aviator so
