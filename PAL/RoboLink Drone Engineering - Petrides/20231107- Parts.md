## DRONE PARTS

## 1	  Hull

"The hull is the external shell or covering that protects the electronic components of the drone from the elements and from damage due to minor collisions.
As a drone pilot your biggest job is to mitigate, or reduce risk. Part of that is providing for as many possible situations as you can. No matter how skilled you are, accidents do happen. If you are flying a small drone in your back yard, you may not need a $1 million insurance policy, but you may want to check your homeowner’s policy to see if you have liability coverage.
Commercial pilots can purchase “Hull Insurance” which covers loss or damage to your drone. Equipment failures do happen. Hull Insurance does not typically cover any payload components such as the camera, sensors or anything else your drone may carry, but it can help cover the total cost to repair or replace the drone itself.
Commercial drone operators should carry drone liability insurance to cover personal injury and property damage. "

## 2	  Propeller Guards	

"Propeller Guards serve to protect the propellers and keep them from coming in contact with obstacles like the wall, the fence, or anything that is not air. If your drone has propeller guards, we highly recommend keeping them on your drone for safety. These are consumable, so keep and extra set on hand. Breaking a guard is always better than ruining a motor, or worse.
Part of your pre-flight checklist is to make sure your propeller guards are installed correctly. Flick the propeller with your finger to make sure it spins freely and does not come in contact with the propeller guard. 
If you have a small drone you may want to take it a step further, especially if flying indoors, by installing a protective cage which is like a propeller guard for your whole drone. It acts like a protective bubble that helps the drone bounce off obstacles and keep flying—and if you have two drones with this cage you can play Sumo Drones!"

## 3	  Propeller	

"Propellers are where the rubber meets the road, or in this case; where the blade meets the air! They must be installed and removed carefully to avoid damage to the motor. There are two different types of propellers; clockwise and counter clockwise. In a quadcopter they must match each other in an “X” pattern. Check your propellers before each launch and replace them if you have any nicks, chips or cracks. If one propeller fails on a quadcopter, your drone is coming down.
Propellers, like propeller guards are consumable. Make sure you have at least one extra set on hand. "

## 4	  Motor	
"Motors are to propellers like a wheel is to a tire. When working together properly they keep your drone in the air. The term Rotor refers to the propeller and the motor, implying that you can’t have one without the other.
Check your drone’s manufacture’s handbook to find out how long a motor is expected to last. Like replacing tires on your car, you don’t want to wait until one fails, which could potentially cause a crash.
Proper care for your motors includes following the manufacturer’s method of removing a propeller. Always use the propeller removal tool if your drone has one. Flying with a chipped or damaged propeller can put extra stress on your motor, because it creates more friction or drag."

## 5	  Sensors	

"Sensors are able to detect obstacles. The number of sensors and their position on the drone determine their influence. Some drones have enough sensors to actually detect and fly around an obstacle. On the TELLO sensors are used as a visual positioning system instead of GPS.
When conducting your pre-flight checklist, make sure all sensors are clear of dust, dirt or debris. If your drone begins flying in unintended ways, it could be because there is dirt on a sensor.
No matter how many sensors your drone has, they can’t replace common sense and diligence to avoid obstacles. Remember, drones don’t have breaks, so the faster you fly, the less likely you’ll be able to avoid an obstacle. In fact, certain flight settings, like sport mode, may disable your sensors completely. Know your drone and the risks before planning your mission."

## 6	  Camera/Gimbal	

"The camera can easily be the most expensive component on a drone. A 3-axis gimbal is a tool that can keep the camera stable even as the drone moves.
Care for your camera and gimbal by keeping your lens clean and the entire unit stabilized and protected when not in use. Adding a filter to your lens helps prevent scratches.
Read your drone manual to learn everything you can about the camera and how to use it. If you’re not an experienced photographer, consider taking a course in photography. Practice flying while adjusting the camera angle and performing different maneuvers while keeping the subject in view. Learn to use all the photo and video settings and don’t be afraid to experiment. Taking good images can be the most rewarding part of the being a drone pilot."

## 7	  Antenna	

"The antenna is a vital component for drone flight because drones use radio waves to communicate with the remote controller. Every movement of the stick is transmitted to the drone’s antenna in almost real time. If your drone is behaving erratically, or weird, it could be due to signal interference. Interference can be caused by many factors including weather, terrain, structures, WIFI signal, high voltage power lines, cellular network towers and microwave antennas. 
If you fly too far from the home point your drone can also lose signal, or connection. If your drone loses connection, it will typically continue to fly the rest of a pre-coded mission. If you are not flying a coded mission it will usually come back to the home point. If it loses GPS signal, it may land because it can’t tell where it is.
A WIFI extender is a good investment for a TELLO because it significantly increases its flight range, but be careful! If you go too far or too high, this could result in loss of your drone."

## 8	  Lights

"Most drones come equipped with lights on each arm. On a quadcopter they are most often red under the front two arms and green under the back, but some drones do differ. The FAA allows certified commercial pilots to fly at night only if it is equipped with lights that are visible from three statute miles away. Typically the lights that your drone came with do not qualify, and additional lights must be added. Only FAA Part 107 Remote Pilots may fly at night with strong lights.
Some drone manufacturers, like DJI, have different patterns of blinking lights under the arms to signal different status indicators. Read your drone manual to learn more."

## 9	  Battery	

"The battery on a quadcopter is typically on the back of the drone, but it can be positioned on the side as well. A hexacopter or octocopter will frequently have six or eight batteries located around the entire body.
Most drones use lithium-ion batteries, but new drone technologies are experimenting with alternative fuels.
Unit 4 provides more detail about the care of lithium-ion batteries, but understand that they can be very dangerous if damaged. Never allow batteries to become overheated, and never use a bulging battery.
Always launch with a full battery and set your drone to return home at 25% of capacity. You should know how long your battery should last, but remember that factors like payload, temperature and wind velocity, can cause the life of a battery to be diminished. Consider investing in extra batteries, because it’s no fun to wait for a battery to charge. "

## 10	  Landing Gear	

"Landing gear is an important part of the drone because it protects the rotors and camera from resting on the ground during take off and landing. Landing gear provides stability during take off and landing so the propellers don’t come in contact with the ground.
Some drones, like the DJI Matrice 600 have retractable landing gear that folds up after launch and folds back down before landing. This makes the aircraft more aerodynamic and ensures that the landing gear won’t get in the way of the camera when taking photos or video.
Drone Cadets also recommends using a helipad to protect your equipment from dirt, debris and moisture. It also protects the rotors from becoming tangled in weeds or tall grass.
