## Unmanned Aerial System (UAS)

The technical name for a drone is an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) or Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (sUAV). <br>
As the name implies, there is no pilot on board the aircraft. <br>
“Small” refers to a consumer drone, like we fly, as opposed to a military drone that can be the size of a manned aircraft or airplane. 

<br> UAV refers to the aircraft itself.

### Drone

noun (AIRCRAFT); [c] an aircraft that does not have a pilot but is controlled by someone on the ground… <br>  /droʊn/<br> <br> 

~ Cambridge Dictionary, Cambridge University Press<br> <br> 

By definition, every drone, or UAV, is part of a larger system. <br> <br> 
The system also includes a Remote Controller (RC) that the Pilot-in-Command uses to launch, land and steer or navigate the drone during flight.<br> 
That’s what makes a drone, a drone. <br> 

It must be operated remotely, either by a pilot manipulating the controls in real-time, or by sending the drone a series of code, or instructions to execute a pre-planned mission.<br> 

For this reason, we tend to use the more all-encompassing name for a drone which is an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) or Small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS). <br> <br> 

This name recognizes that a drone can’t fly by itself. It’s part of a larger system that includes a drone AND a remote controller. <br>
see also: Small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS) <br>

Other Names you may see or hear referring to a drone Remote Controller Include: <br>

Controller <br>
RC <br>
Radio Controller <br>
Radio <br>
Radio Transmitter <br>
Transmitter <br>
“Sticks” <br>

Many drones, like the TELLO for example, can be operated via a Remote Controller App downloaded to a tablet or smartphone.  <br>

In this case, the screen of the smartphone or tablet (device) becomes a Virtual Controller.  <br>
Your fingers control the drone by touching the screen.  <br>
This type of drone normally connects via a WIFI signal from the phone or tablet to the drone. <br> <br>

# CONTROLLER

It’s also very common for a drone to utilize its own hand-held Remote Controller. <br>
This unit usually has some form of “sticks” or 360-degree levers that are manipulated to make the drone move or navigate through the air. <br>
The TELLO may be also operated by this type of remote controller; the GameSir T1D or the GameSir T1S which is shown here. <br>

If the drone has a camera, its Remote Controller may come equipped with its very own screen, used to view what the drone’s camera sees.  <br>
See the white controller on the right in the photo below which is part of the DJI Phantom 4 Pro+ system. <br> <br>

If the Remote Controller for a camera drone does not have its own screen, it will most likely be equipped to hold a phone or tablet in a cradle. <br>
Again, you would download an app and then connect your phone or tablet to the Remote Controller with either a cord or via Bluetooth®.<br>

After you connect your device to the RC, you will still need to connect the Remote Controller to the drone. <br>
For short-range drones (like a TELLO) this will be done over WIFI. <br>
For longer-range drones (like the DJI Phantom) this is done via radio waves. <br> 
Notice that each of the two larger white controllers in the photo above is equipped with two radio antennas.<br>

A Drone Racing controller also connects to a drone via radio waves.<br>
See the grey controller on the lower left which is a Jumper T12. <br>
This type of controller is meant to be able to connect to many different types and brands of drones. <br>
It also may have several different channels or frequencies.<br>

Let’s review the virtual controller found in the TELLO APP in more detail.<br>

On the upper left-hand side of the screen is the Icon with an arrow, used for Take-off and Landing. <br>
Going across the top, from left to right we see additional icons for:<br>

The most important part of the controller is known as the sticks! This is what you’ve been waiting for, and, if you have a drone, you can use this to fly your first mission today. <br>
(If you don’t have a drone, you can still download the TELLO App and follow along.) <br>
Refer back to the image above with the two big circles on the lower left and lower right of the controller screen found in the TELLO App. <br>
If your drone has its own Remote Controller, refer to the two control sticks, or 360-degree levers, now.  <br>
Every drone remote controller or transmitter, has some form of these same controls. <br>

If you have a drone, don’t turn it on yet. First you need to learn how to fly. <br>

# LEFT STICK

**THROTTLE:** means to go up or down, used to change height or altitude. <br><br>
Altitude is the vertical distance above a surface, which is usually measured as the distance above the ground or sea level.<br>

Virtual Controller: use your LEFT THUMB. <br><br>
Put your thumb on the small circle, or dot, in the middle of the larger circle. <br>
Slowly and gently slide your thumb up to the 12 o’clock position to THROTTLE Up, and down to the 6 o’clock position to THROTTLE Down. <br>

Try to remain inside the larger circle when you slide your finger.<br><br>
Remote Controller: take hold of the left stick between your LEFT THUMB & INDEX or POINTER FINGER , or just use your RIGHT THUMB and slowly push it towards the 12 o’clock position to THROTTLE Up and the 6 o’clock position to THROTTLE Down.
 

**YAW:** Means to turn left or right. The drone is said to YAW when it rotates on a fixed vertical axis.<br><br>

For any type of controller: do the same thing only move the LEFT STICK to the left or right.<br>
To turn left, or YAW Left; move the stick or slide the circle to the left (9 o’clock position).<br>
To turn right, or YAW Right, move the stick or slide the circle to the right (3 o’clock position).<br>



# RIGHT STICK

**PITCH:** Means to fly forward or backward.<br><br>

Virtual Controller: use your RIGHT THUMB. <br>
Put your thumb on the small circle, or dot, in the middle of the larger circle. <br>
Slowly and gently slide your thumb up to the 12 o’clock position to PITCH Forward, and down to the 6 o’clock position to PITCH Backward. <br>
Try to remain inside the larger circle when you slide your finger. <br>
(If your drone were to fail to respond, it could be because your finger went too far outside the larger circle.)<br><br>

Remote Controller: take hold of the right stick between your RIGHT THUMB & INDEX or POINTER FINGER, or just use your RIGHT THUMB and slowly push it towards the top (12 o’clock position) to PITCH Forward, and the bottom (6 o’clock position) to PITCH Backward.
 

**ROLL:** Means to fly to the right or to the left.<br><br>

Virtual Controller: use your RIGHT THUMB. <br>
Put your thumb on the small circle, or dot, in the middle of the larger circle. <br><br>
Slowly and gently slide your thumb left to the 9 o’clock position to ROLL Left, and right to the 3 o’clock position to ROLL Right Again, try to remain inside the larger circle when you slide your finger. If your drone fails to respond, check to see if your finger went too far outside the larger circle by mistake.<br><br>

Remote Controller: take hold of the right stick between your **RIGHT THUMB** INDEX or POINTER FINGER or just use your RIGHT THUMB and slowly push it towards the left (9 o’clock position) to ROLL Left, and the right (3 o’clock position) to ROLL Right.
