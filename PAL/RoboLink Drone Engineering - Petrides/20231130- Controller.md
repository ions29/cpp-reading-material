## Using a TELLO Controller

## Unmanned Aerial System (UAS)

The technical name for a drone is an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) or Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (sUAV). <br>
As the name implies, there is no pilot on board the aircraft. <br>
“Small” refers to a consumer drone, like we fly, as opposed to a military drone that can be the size of a manned aircraft or airplane. 

<br> UAV refers to the aircraft itself.

### Drone

noun (AIRCRAFT); [c] an aircraft that does not have a pilot but is controlled by someone on the ground… <br>  /droʊn/<br> <br> 

~ Cambridge Dictionary, Cambridge University Press<br> <br> 

By definition, every drone, or UAV, is part of a larger system. <br> <br> 
The system also includes a Remote Controller (RC) that the Pilot-in-Command uses to launch, land and steer or navigate the drone during flight.<br> 
That’s what makes a drone, a drone. <br> 

It must be operated remotely, either by a pilot manipulating the controls in real-time, or by sending the drone a series of code, or instructions to execute a pre-planned mission.<br> 

For this reason, we tend to use the more all-encompassing name for a drone which is an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) or Small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS). <br> <br> 

This name recognizes that a drone can’t fly by itself. It’s part of a larger system that includes a drone AND a remote controller. <br>

Other Names you may see or hear referring to a drone Remote Controller Include: <br>

Controller <br>
RC <br>
Radio Controller <br>
Radio <br>
Radio Transmitter <br>
Transmitter <br>
“Sticks” <br>

Many drones, like the TELLO for example, can be operated via a Remote Controller App downloaded to a tablet or smartphone.  <br>

In this case, the screen of the smartphone or tablet (device) becomes a Virtual Controller.  <br>
Your fingers control the drone by touching the screen.  <br>
This type of drone normally connects via a WIFI signal from the phone or tablet to the drone. <br> <br>

# CONTROLLER

It’s also very common for a drone to utilize its own hand-held Remote Controller. <br>
This unit usually has some form of “sticks” or 360-degree levers that are manipulated to make the drone move or navigate through the air. <br>
The TELLO may be also operated by this type of remote controller; the GameSir T1D or the GameSir T1S which is shown here. <br>

If the drone has a camera, its Remote Controller may come equipped with its very own screen, used to view what the drone’s camera sees.  <br>
See the white controller on the right in the photo below which is part of the DJI Phantom 4 Pro+ system. <br> <br>

If the Remote Controller for a camera drone does not have its own screen, it will most likely be equipped to hold a phone or tablet in a cradle. <br>
Again, you would download an app and then connect your phone or tablet to the Remote Controller with either a cord or via Bluetooth®.<br>

After you connect your device to the RC, you will still need to connect the Remote Controller to the drone. <br>
For short-range drones (like a TELLO) this will be done over WIFI. <br>
For longer-range drones (like the DJI Phantom) this is done via radio waves. <br> 
Notice that each of the two larger white controllers in the photo above is equipped with two radio antennas.<br>

A Drone Racing controller also connects to a drone via radio waves.<br>
See the grey controller on the lower left which is a Jumper T12. <br>
This type of controller is meant to be able to connect to many different types and brands of drones. <br>
It also may have several different channels or frequencies.<br>

Let’s review the virtual controller found in the TELLO APP in more detail.<br>

On the upper left-hand side of the screen is the Icon with an arrow, used for Take-off and Landing. <br>
Going across the top, from left to right we see additional icons for:<br>

Intelligent Flight Modes<br>
Battery level indicator<br>
WiFi Status<br>
Bluetooth® Status<br>
Drone Data<br>
Image & Video View<br>
Camera & Video Switch<br>
Take a Picture or Record a Video<br>

The most important part of the controller is known as the sticks! This is what you’ve been waiting for, and, if you have a drone, you can use this to fly your first mission today. <br>
(If you don’t have a drone, you can still download the TELLO App and follow along.) <br>
Refer back to the image above with the two big circles on the lower left and lower right of the controller screen found in the TELLO App. <br>
If your drone has its own Remote Controller, refer to the two control sticks, or 360-degree levers, now.  <br>
Every drone remote controller or transmitter, has some form of these same controls. <br>

If you have a drone, don’t turn it on yet. First you need to learn how to fly. <br>
