### Flight Dimensions
we call these names navigational direction terminology to help us understand
what we are describing let's first talk about the dimensions of the world in which we live a picture

drawing tablet or even a tv screen has two dimensions<br><br>

if we plotted these two dimensions on a graph or a chart we'd call them the x-axis and the y-axis the x and y axis describes a flat world<br>

on tv or in a movie everything is represented to us on a flat screen <br>

we call the two dimensions width and height<br><br>

It's the difference between a square and a cube a square has two dimensions width and height

a cube has three dimensions width height and depth

## Drone Flight dimensions

we have to think of it in three dimensions or as we say 3d<br>
