## Pilot in Command (PIC)

**Leader, PIC, Pilot in Command**<br>
A.	Responsible for conduction a pre-flight checklist.<br>

## Visual Observer (VO)

A.	Conducts the pre flight safety check using a pre-flight checklist.<br>
B.	Maintain the Line of Sight (LOS) and Visual Line of Sight (VLOS)<br>
---- Watching through the lens of your drone’s camera is NOT maintaining Line of sight or LOS.<br>
C.	Be aware of obstacles.<br>
D.	Maintain communication with PIC at all times.<br>
---- OBSTACLES, things that get into your way.<br>
---- i.	Chairs.<br>
---- ii.	Tables.<br>
---- iii.	People.<br>


# VISUAL LINE OF SIGHT

1. Visual Line of Sight (VLOS)
2. Line of Sight (LOS)

## Scenario #1

o	If your drone has a camera, you can see exactly what it sees, right
o	What if, you fly outside the room you’re in, while you stay where you are. Let’s also assume you keep your eyes on the screen of the controller so you can see exactly what your drone sees, AND you know exactly where it is.
o	Is that maintaining LOS or Line of Sight?
Think about it. Can the drone see what’s above it? Can it see what’s next to it, or behind it? No. That’s why it’s dangerous. Watching through the lens of your drone’s camera is NOT maintaining Line of sight or LOS.


## Scenario #2

o	Let’s use the same scenario as before, except this time you are the PIC and you are accompanied by a VO. You (the PIC) stay where you are, in the room, watching the controller screen, and the VO goes out into the hall or the next room WITH the drone, keeping the drone in his or her Line of Sight every second of the flight.
o	Is that safe?
No! It’s not, because the Visual Observer’s job is not done yet. Maintaining Line of Sight is only part of what helps keep the flight safe.
Remember the VO has four duties and Number four is to communicate with the PIC. This rule does not refer to some of the time. It means at all times. It’s also the PIC’s job to communicate with the team. In Scenario #2, the PIC and VO are NOT communicating, so they are not working together as a team.


### OBSTACLES

**The most important obstacle to avoid is the people.** <br>



It’s also the VO’s job to identify potential obstacles. The word “obstacle” simply means; things that get in your way. These are things you need to avoid hitting. You should go around them, or stay far away from them.<br><br>
Take a moment right now and identify some obstacles you see around you.<br><br>
Depending on your location, you may say; “The floor, ceiling, walls, chair, table, etc., etc.!”<br><br>
The building, the house, the trees, the pole, the car, the wire, the fence, the water, the animals, etc., etc.!”<br><br>
These are all very important things to avoid. Of course, everyone agrees that you shouldn’t hit ANYTHING with your drone, but there’s one more very important obstacle to avoid. In fact, as Drone Cadets we think it’s the most important obstacle of all. It’s you, your team, your family, friends, and anyone else that may be near you. Please ALWAYS avoid people, first and foremost. People CANNOT be replaced. Your drone and any other obstacles are not as important as people.<br><br>

#### Obstacles are things:

a. That get in your way<br>
b. You need to avoid hitting<br>
c. You should go around<br>
d. To stay far away from<br>
e.All of the above<br>

## Scenario 1

If the PIC and VO are standing together at spot #1, and their drone is flying at spot #2, are they maintaining Line of Sight (LOS)?

NO, they are not maintaining Line of Sight(LOS)

## Scenario 2 Communications

Lack of communication between team members can cause an unsafe drone flight.<br>



If the PIC is standing over behind the building, and the VO is standing on the sidewalk in front of the window by the "SALE" signs, and their red drone is flying out front, <br>

** are they following the roles of the team? **

NO, in this scenario the PIC and the VO are not able to communicate with each other.
