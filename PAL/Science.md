* In your lab-books, describe how **VERSION 1** is *DIFFERENT* from **VERSION 2**
* **FOR EXAMPLE:** In Version 2, the color of the slime is White, and in Version 1 the color was _______. <br/><br/>

 <br/>
 
* In your lab-books, describe how could I make the aesthetic of **VERSION 2** to resemble **VERSION 1**<br/>
* **FOR EXAMPLE:** I think we could have changed the recipe in **Version 2** to resemble **Version 1** by _________. <br/><br/>

# INGREDIENTS FOR THIS CLASS!

* We will need 5 ingredients in order to conduct the experiment for this class!

### INGREDIENT #1: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **1/2 a cup** of PVA white glue.

<br/> <br/>The polymer chains in the Elmer's glue are long and very straight. The polymer chains can slide across each other easily, making the glue runny and "liquidy" (think of dumping a bunch of fresh-cooked spaghetti out of a pot). This changes, however, when you mix the glue with borax. The borax helps make connections between each of the polymer chains, as shown in Figure 1. This process is called crosslinking. This makes it harder for the polymer chains to slide around, making the glue thicker and turning it into "slime."

<br/> <br/> In this project, you will use contact lens solution to make slime. It contains other ingredients (boric acid and sodium borate) that react with baking soda (another ingredient in your slime) to make borax. You might wonder if it matters how much borax you add to the glue. Changing the recipe can change the properties of the slime! In science, a property is something about a material that you can observe and measure, for example its weight, color, or stickiness. In this science project, you will make slime with different amounts of contact lens solution. You will then test the slime and observe how its properties change as the recipe changes. Once you have tested all your slime recipes, you can decide for yourself which one results in slime that will be the most fun to play with. If you were going to sell slime as a toy, which recipe would you use?


### INGREDIENT #2:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **1/2 teaspoon** of baking soda.
<br/> <br/>Adding baking soda to your slime recipe helps it have more form and firmness. If your slime is too oozy-gooey, add another pinch of baking soda to help it firm up. Continue adding baking soda a pinch at a time until the slime is your preferred consistency.

### INGREDIENT #3:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **2 drops** of food coloring.
<br/> <br/> Adding food coloring adds a certain color to your slime.

### INGREDIENT #4:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **1 tablespoon** of eye contact solution (must contain boric acid and sodium borate)
<br/> <br/> Contact lens solution contains traces of boric acid. The "borate ions" and the PVA glue generate a cross-linking reaction. Since the acidity of the borate ions destroys the cross-linking effect, the slightly alkaline baking soda can neutralize the reaction and increase the viscosity of the slug.
<br/> <br/> The higher the viscosity of a liquid, the thicker it is and the greater the resistance to flow.

### INGREDIENT #5:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **5 Drops** of Baby oil.
<br/> <br/> Prevent the slime mixture from being too sticky. 

* We will additionally require a bowl and spoon (or you can use your hands) for mixing!

 <br/>
 
* In your lab-books, list all of the ingredients in our Lab Experiment, and what the Ingredients do.<br/>
* **FOR EXAMPLE:** We will be using the PVA as a base to our Experiment <br/><br/>


# STEPS

**Step 1:**  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mix the **PVA WHITE GLUE** with 1/2 a teaspoon of **BAKING SODA** <br/><br/>

**Step 2:**  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ass the **FOOD COLORING** - just a couple of drops into the mixture and Mix well!<br/><br/>

**Step 3:** Mix in the **EYE CONTACT SOLUTION** - this is the Activating Agent.<br/><br/>

**Step 4:** Add a few drops of **BABY OIL** - prevents Slime from being too sticky.<br/><br/>
