Dear Class,
   
For convenience, I have included the instructions to complete this very important assignment.

To be fair to your classmates who have/ are close to completing this on-time, 
I must deduct 25 points from the group for each day it is late.

Keep in mind, your Group scores are reflected onto your individual scores (same as last) 
- please try to stay on top of this.
