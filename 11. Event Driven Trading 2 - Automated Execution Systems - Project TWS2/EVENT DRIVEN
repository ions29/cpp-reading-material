# EXAMPLE 1.  BASIC EVENT DRIVEN TRADE ORDER.
  
  IF THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE MOVES NORTH BY 100 POINTS BASED ON YESTERDAY'S CLOSING POINTS.
  >> SEND IN THESE MARKET ORDERS.
  [+] BUY 100 SHARES OF MSFT, AAPL, TSLA, BTC, ETH, AND TWO OTHER ASSETS WHICH ARE NOT STOCKS OR CRYPTOS... AT MARKET.
  
  IF THE S&P 500 INDEX MOVES SOUTH BY 5 POINTS BASED ON YESTERDAY'S CLOSING PRICE, SEND IN THESE MARKET ORDERS.
  [+] SELL 100 SHARES OF AMZN, IBM, GOOG, LTC, MATIC, AND TWO OTHER ASSETS WHICH ARE NOT STOCKS OR CRYPTOS... AT MARKET.

I WANT YOUR APPLICATION TO SYSTEMICALLY CHECK FOR THE PRICE OF BOTH THE DJIA & S&P 500 INDICES, AND UPON DISCOVERY OF ANY OF THE ABOVE CONDITIONS..
  - IMMEDIATELY FIRE OFF A SEQUENCE OF ORDER AS REFERENCED ABOVE.
  
REMINDER: FLAT FILE.
  - YOUR PROGRAM IS CONSTANTLY UPDATING A FLAT FILE WITH INFORMATION AND UPON DISCOVERY OF A DIFFERENCE IN THE INDEX PRICE...
  [+] FIRE OFF THE ORDERS..

*** I WANT YOU CHECKING THIS IN ONE MINUTE INTERVALS
    UPON DISCOVERY OF THE CONDITIONS ABOVE... 
      FIRE A THREAD TO BULL OR SELL AS REFERENCED ABOVE.
        PX0 = YESTERDAY'S CLOSING PRICE
        PX1 = PRICE AT 930AM.   LAST TRADE PRICE, OR MID PRICE (WHICHEVER IS AVAILABLE)
        PX2 = PRICE AT 931AM.   ""
        PX3 = PRICE AT 932AM.   ""
***

AT EVERY MINUTE YOU ARE UPDATING THE FLAT FILE NO MATTER WHAT.
- YOU HAVE TO PULL OFF A THREAD TO SEND SEND THE BUY OR SELL ORDER... 
- BUT KEEP THIS NODE HOVERING AROUND THE PRICE OF THE S&P 500 AND DOW JONES AT ALL TIMES.

THIS IS WHAT YOUR FLAT FILE SHOULD LOOK LIKE.
  DATE IN THIS FORMAT [YYYYMMDD], PX0, PX1, PX2, PX3,.... UNTIL THE END OF THE DAY.
  
# EXAMPLE 2.  MARKET SPECIFIC TRADE ORDER.
  100:1 CRUDE OIL PRICES MOVE HIGHER. A LOT.
  [ + ] WHICH UNDERLYING STOCKS WOULD YOU SEND A MARKET ORDER TO BUY.
  [ + ] SHOW ME THAT WHEN YOU TURN YOUR PROGRAM ON, IT FIRST SENDS THIS ORDER AS A BOOTSTAP.
        - IN YOU MAIN PROGRAM FILE, AFTER YOU ESTABLISH THE CONNECTION IT SHOULD CALL A CLASS LIKE SO.
          - buyCrudeOil()
            >> this should call another class/method that sends the market orders to buy the associated equities at Market, like above.
            
  
   
# Example 3.  Define your own event, but first submit a txt file in your repo with the event, and what stocks will be affected.
  - it can be for better or for worse.
  - i.e. silicone valley is being held hostage by ISIS for 90-days, what happens to the price of IBM? Lower... so sell IBM.
