  - It is unlawful to short a Municipal Bond FYI :)

    i.      CREATE A FOLDER IN YOUR REPOSITORY AND NAME IT "SEA RULE PROJECT 1"
      
    ii.     ADD A FILE IN THE FOLDER AND NAME IT TICKERS, AND MAKE A LIST OF THE CONID, SECURITY IDENTIFIER, AND DETAILS.

PART B.

Once you are satisfied with the positions you have accumulated, you want to output the following onto a spreadsheet
*** Your program should automatically calculate the 15c3-1 requirement using the guidelines we covereed in class.

  [OUTPUT]    ITEMA, TICKER, CONTRACT DETAILS, POSITION (LONG/SHORT), QUANTITY, PRICE, CASH ALLOCATION, ***SEA Rule 15c3-1 NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENT***
              ITEMB, TICKER, CONTRACT DETAILS, POSITION (LONG/SHORT), QUANTITY, PRICE, CASH ALLOCATION, ***SEA Rule 15c3-1 NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENT***
              ITEMC, TICKER, CONTRACT DETAILS, POSITION (LONG/SHORT), QUANTITY, PRICE, CASH ALLOCATION, ***SEA Rule 15c3-1 NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENT***
              . . .

*** SUPPLEMENTS TO HELP YOU COMPLETE THIS SECTION ****
You need to upload these screenshots of your groups TWS configuration, in addition to an output .csv file that has cased your positions and outputs the SEA capital requirements for what you are holding in inventory.

Screenshots of your TWS

		## (250) Account Information
		https://github.com/ions29/cpp-reading-material/blob/main/Final%20Project/CaptureAccountInformation.PNG

		## (250) Trade Blotter
		https://github.com/ions29/cpp-reading-material/blob/main/Final%20Project/CaptureTradeBlotter.PNG

		## (250) Margin (Reg-T)
		https://github.com/ions29/cpp-reading-material/blob/main/Final%20Project/CaptureMargin.PNG

		## (250) These should correlate to thee output file that your program outputs, which you will also upload to your group REPO.

		*** Without the output FILE the score is zero.
		*** So you must calculate the SEA 153c1 requirements autonomously using your trading applications.

You can refer back to the % and requirements in the previous section on Risk Management which you completed.
https://github.com/ions29/cpp-reading-material/tree/main/Risk%20Management

!! Reminder: You need to be able to automatically qualify

   // Asset Type
   	GOVT/ CORP/ MUNI/ EQUITY/ ETC...
	
   // Maturity
   
   // Credit Rating
   
   // Coupon

!! In order to calculate the SEA 153c1 Requirements for each position, and in aggregate.

Make sure you get this done on time, you have ~2 weeks which is more than enough to move on to Part C, which will be due the following Friday
May 19TH.

PART C. DUE: FRIDAY MAY 19TH
    
Portfolio Exposure Summary  
REG-T IS WHAT YOU ARE DEALING WITH FOR THIS SECTION OF YOUR FINAL PROJECT.

Your Portfolio Exposure Summary should calculate the Reg-T requirement in lieu of the SEA Rule you all used in the previous assignment.          
	RSS: REG-T
	    Here is the information you should read and understand because it is what is available generically to most individuals and institutions.
  	    https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/key-topics/margin-accounts
 
  
	- REMINDER: WHEN YOU MAX OUT YOUR AVAILABLE CASH AND USE LEVERAGE
	
        		- IF THE POSITIONS MOVE AGAINST YOU... 
			- TWS INTERACTIVE WILL AUTOMATICALLY START LIQUIDATING THE POSITIONS IN YOUR ACCOUNT
 
		25% for equities, etc. (4:1 Leverage)
		etc...
              
*** PLEASE ALSO CONSIDER THE "NETTING OF POSITIONS" FOR A BONUS ***

*** I WILL AWARD THE MOST NOTIONAL DOLLAR EXPOSURE AWARD AT THE END OF THE PROJECT IN CASE YOU ARE FALLING BEHIND YOUR CLASS MATES!
  
  ** output file should be in *.csv or *.txt and look something like this.
  
  [OUTPUT]    {CT LONG POS, CT SHORT POS, TTL SHARES LONG, TTL SHARES SHORT, TTL $LONG, TTL $SHORT, TTL $LONG + $SHORT CASH, SEA 15c3-1, REG-T }
      
		*** Your program should already calculate the 15c3-1 requirement using the guidelines we covered in class, 
		*** Add another column/structure that calculates and buffers out the REG-T Requirement as well.

//Risk Management

https://github.com/ions29/cpp-reading-material/tree/main/Risk%20Management

Here is the documentation for the IBKR TWS API, I would recommend pulling a few contract from the API to take a closer look at the 
  Object variables in the scope of this exercise.

  https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/classIBApi_1_1ContractDetails.html


We are looking to qualify and case the following information to determine the minimum capital requirements for the following instruments.   

  - Asset Type (Govt, Corp, Muni, etc...) 

  - Corporate Name/ Identifier (US Treasury, AAPL Corp, New York State, etc...)
  
  - Coupon (Don't forget to check for zero coupon bonds)
  
  - Maturity (You can obtain this by parsing the string in the contract details)

  - Rating  (You can obtain this by parsing the string in the contract details)

Rules to determine Minimum Net Capital Requirements.
- https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/SEA.Rule_.15c3-1.Interpretations.pdf

Credit Ratings should be qualified using a combined methodology as all instruments are not necessarily rated by all/any of the 
three major credit ratings agencies (S&P, Moody's, Fitch).

    Moody's
    - https://ratings.moodys.io/ratings

    S&P Capital IQ
    - https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/

    Fitch
    - https://www.fitchratings.com/

TWS API References
https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/classIBApi_1_1ContractDetails.html

*** These three items will pretty much hold most of the information you are looking for

string DescAppend
  A description string containing further descriptive information about the bond. For Bonds only.

string BondType
  The type of bond, such as "CORP.".
 
string ContractMonth
  Typically the contract month of the underlying for a Future contract. 

Here are some additional resources which you can refer to to help you qualify the assets that you are running through your algorithms.
