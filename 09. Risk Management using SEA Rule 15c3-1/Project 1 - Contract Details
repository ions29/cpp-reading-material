int 	PriceMagnifier

In TWS versions prior to 972, the price magnifier is used in defining future option strike prices (e.g. in the API the strike is specified in dollars, but in TWS it is specified in cents). In TWS versions 972 and higher, the price magnifier is not used in defining futures option strike prices so they are consistent in TWS and the API.
