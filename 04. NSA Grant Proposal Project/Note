Dear Class,
   
I have received Part 1 from all Groups, and have posted your group scores in the Project Repository. 

- Group 3 still needs to email me a copy for my records.
   
https://github.com/ions29/cpp-reading-material/blob/main/Grants/_Groups


This is what we will be working on in your groups tomorrow.
- Be prepared to submit ~3 pages which represents a biography of your groups, notwithstanding their professional experience, coding experience, and any other relevant information you think would help to persuade a panel from selecting your team for funding!


At a minimum. The quoter shall provide background materials evidencing its knowledge of the industry and data capabilities. Background materials may include descriptions of current data
systems, testing protocols, staff qualifications, and any other relevant information.
